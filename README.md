# Web Development Recommended

<!-- Hi all, my name is Mendy Leizerovich and I work as a web developer. I wanted a place that I could save and share all the Chrome extensions and the VSCode ones that I use.-->

Some recommended extensions and others for web development.

These are the primary programs that I currently use:

* Text Editor - [VSCode extensions](./vscode-extensions.md)
* Browser - [Chrome extensions](./chrome-extensions.md)
* Command line (windows) - [Cmder](./cmder.md) -- (_Still in progress..._)
* Git - [Git Config](./git-config.md)
