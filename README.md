# Web Development Recommended

<!-- Hi all, my name is Mendy Leizerovich and I work as a web developer. I wanted a place that I could save and share all the Chrome extensions and the VSCode ones that I use.-->

Some recommended extensions and others for web development.

These are the primary programs that I currently use:

* Text Editor - [VSCode extensions](./vscode-extensions.md)
* Browser - [Chrome extensions](./chrome-extensions.md)
* Command line (windows)
  * [Cmder](./command-line/cmder.md) -- (_Still in progress..._)
  * [Usefully commands](./command-line/usefully-commands-comand-line.md)
* Git
  * [Git Config](./git/git-config.md)
  * [Usefully commands](./git/usefully-commands-comand-git.md)
* NPM - [Usefully commands](./npm-usefully-commands.md)
